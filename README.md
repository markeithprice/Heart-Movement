                    <summary>Snatch</summary>
                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A single, explosive movement where a barbell is lifted from the floor to an overhead position. The lifter pulls the bar as high as possible and drops under it into a deep overhead squat, then stands up.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Develops total body power, speed, coordination, and mobility. Engages nearly every muscle group, particularly the posterior chain, shoulders, and core.</p>

                </details>

                    <summary>Clean and Jerk</summary>
                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A two-part lift. First, the 'clean' moves the barbell from the floor to a racked position on the shoulders. Second, the 'jerk' moves the bar from the shoulders to an overhead position.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds incredible strength and power. Excellent for developing leg drive, shoulder stability, and overall athletic performance.</p>

                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Power Snatch</summary>
                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A variation of the snatch where the barbell is caught in a partial or quarter-squat position, rather than a full deep squat. Requires more explosive pulling power.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Excellent for developing explosive power and speed without the same mobility demands as a full snatch. Great for athletes in sports requiring quick bursts of energy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A variation of the clean where the barbell is caught on the shoulders in a quarter-squat position. It emphasizes explosive pulling strength.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds explosive power in the hips and legs, improves coordination, and strengthens the upper back and shoulders. Widely used in athletic training.</p>

                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A snatch variation where the lift starts with the barbell "hanging" from the hands, typically at mid-thigh or knee level, instead of from the floor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Helps to isolate and strengthen the second pull of the snatch, improving power and technique for the full lift. Reduces stress on the lower back.</p>

                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A clean variation where the lift starts with the barbell "hanging" from the hands, usually above the knees.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Focuses on developing explosive hip extension and speed in the second pull of the clean. A great teaching tool for beginners.</p>

                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An assistance exercise where the lifter starts with the barbell on their back, then quickly drops under it into an overhead squat, catching it in the snatch receiving position.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds speed, confidence, and stability in the receiving portion of the snatch. Improves overhead squat strength and mobility.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A squat performed while holding a barbell locked out overhead with a wide grip.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Develops exceptional core strength, shoulder stability, and mobility in the hips, ankles, and thoracic spine. A cornerstone of the snatch.</p>

                    <div class="details-content">
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The second part of the clean and jerk. The lifter dips and drives the barbell from the shoulders overhead, often splitting the legs into a lunge to receive the bar.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Develops powerful leg drive, upper body pressing strength, and total-body coordination. Allows lifters to move maximal weights overhead.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An overhead press that uses a dip and drive from the legs to help propel the barbell upward. The legs do not re-bend to catch the bar.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds overhead pressing strength and power. Teaches the coordination of using leg drive to assist the upper body.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The first portion of the snatch, where the lifter explosively pulls the barbell from the floor to as high as possible without dropping underneath it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Strengthens the pulling muscles (back, traps, legs) and reinforces the correct bar path for the snatch. Allows for overloading the pull.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pulling portion of the clean. The lifter explosively pulls the barbell from the floor to the upper chest level without racking it on the shoulders.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds immense pulling strength and power from the floor. Reinforces the powerful triple extension (ankles, knees, hips) needed for the clean.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A snatch variation performed with a narrower grip and without re-bending the knees. The bar is pulled and pressed into the overhead position in one continuous motion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds upper body strength and reinforces a high, close bar path. Excellent for warm-ups and technique work with lighter weights.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A deadlift variation with a very wide stance and a grip inside the knees. The torso remains more upright compared to the conventional deadlift.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Emphasizes the hips, glutes, and quads more than the conventional style. Can be a better option for lifters with certain body types or back issues.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A squat performed with the barbell resting across the front of the shoulders (front rack position). This forces a more upright torso.</p>
